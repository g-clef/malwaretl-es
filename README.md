# malwaretl-es
ElasticSearch k8s configurations for malwaretl

To install, first install the EKS operator with helm, as documented here: 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/master/k8s-install-helm.html

The add the secrets, then the storageclass, then the persistent-volumes, then the actual cluster.

You will want to pull the auto-generated credentials out of the cluster, and apply them to your other secrets.
To get those creds, run:

`kubectl get secret malwaretl-cluster-es-elastic-user -n es -o go-template='{{.data.elastic | base64decode}}'`

Apply that secret to the collector secrets so that they can access ES.
